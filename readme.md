# turnaround-api  -async
Cloudflare turnstile solver API, based on [turnaround](https://github.com/Body-Alhoha/turnaround). Made using Python & flask

## Example  async
Python code example [here](https://github.com/tw1tt3r/turnaround-async/blob/main/example.py)

## Installing  
First, install the requirements:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If it's your first time running playwright or you're using a virtual environment, you'll need to install the playwright browser:  
```bash
python -m playwright install
```
Then, run the server:  
```bash
python main.py
```
The server will be running on port 5000 by default, you can change it in main.py.
